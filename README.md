## Visualizing Cancer Treatment Study


### __Tools/Techniques Used:__
- __Matplotlib:__ Utilized to create a variety of data visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, line plots, scatter plots, and box plots.
- __Data Preparation:__ Cleaning and merging data using Pandas DataFrames.
- __Descriptive Statistics:__ Calculating mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM (Standard Error of the Mean) for tumor volume.
- __Correlation and Regression:__ Determining the relationship between variables and generating linear regression models.
- __GitHub/GitLab:__ Version control and collaboration platform for project management.
  
### __Purpose:__
Data scientists tell stories with data. The Python visualization library, Matplotlib, is used to analyze a real-world dataset and create informative visualizations. IN this project, data from joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications, is analyze; the data comes from a study to identify potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer.

Granted access to the data from the latest animal study, this dataset includes information about 249 mice that received various drug regimens for SCC tumors. Over a span of 45 days, the progression of tumor development was observed and measured. Compare the effectiveness of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens.

After data wrangling is completed, tables, figures and a top-level summary are generated for the technical report of this clinical study.
