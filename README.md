## Project README: Data Visualization for Anti-Cancer Medication Study

**Project Overview:**
"What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?" In this assignment, you will leverage your knowledge of Matplotlib to analyze a real-world dataset and create informative visualizations.

**Background:**
You've joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. The company is engaged in a study to identify potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst, you've been granted access to the complete data from the latest animal study. The dataset includes information about 249 mice that received various drug regimens for SCC tumors. Over a span of 45 days, the progression of tumor development was observed and measured. The primary focus of the study is to compare the effectiveness of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens.

Your task involves generating tables, figures, and a top-level summary for the technical report of this clinical study.

**Tools/Techniques Used:**
- Matplotlib: Utilized to create a variety of data visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, line plots, scatter plots, and box plots.
- Data Preparation: Cleaning and merging data using Pandas DataFrames.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculating mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for tumor volume.
- Correlation and Regression: Determining the relationship between variables and generating linear regression models.
- GitHub/GitLab: Version control and collaboration platform for project management.

**Project Tasks:**
1. Prepare the data by merging relevant DataFrames and eliminating duplicate data.
2. Generate summary statistics, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for tumor volume, grouped by drug regimen.
3. Create bar charts and pie charts to visualize the distribution of data.
4. Calculate quartiles, identify outliers, and create a box plot to visualize the spread of final tumor volume for specific treatment regimens.
5. Create a line plot to showcase tumor volume changes over time for a specific mouse treated with Capomulin.
6. Generate a scatter plot to illustrate the correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment group.
7. Calculate correlation and regression to quantitatively assess the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.
8. Integrate the linear regression model into the scatter plot for visual representation.

This project enables you to demonstrate your proficiency in data visualization and analysis, presenting the insights gained from the anti-cancer medication study in an engaging and informative manner.
